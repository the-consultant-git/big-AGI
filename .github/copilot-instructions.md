# Copilot Instructions

<!-- ## Coding Style Preferences

- **Prioritize simplicity over complexity**: Write clean, straightforward code without unnecessary abstractions.
- **Focus on functionality first**: Implement core features before optimization or elegant solutions.
- **Be direct and pragmatic**: Don't overengineer solutions or add unnecessary functionality.
- **Comment important logic**: Add concise comments for complex sections, but avoid excessive commenting for obvious code.
- **Use clear variable names**: Prefer descriptive variable names that indicate purpose.

## Data Processing Projects

- **Optimize for readability in data pipelines**: Structure code in logical processing stages.
- **Focus on core metrics and columns**: Avoid creating unnecessary derived columns unless specifically requested.
- **Prefer pandas operations**: When working with data frames, leverage pandas built-in functions over custom loops.
- **Error handling**: Include robust error handling for file operations and data transformations.
- **Logging**: Include informative logging at key stages of processing.

## Preferred Python Patterns

- **Use functions with clear purposes**: Each function should do one thing well.
- **Consistent parameter typing**: Use type hints for function parameters and return values.
- **Follow PEP 8**: Adhere to Python style guidelines for consistency.
- **Docstrings**: Include docstrings for functions with parameter descriptions.
- **Error messages**: Create informative error messages that help with debugging.

## Code Generation Preferences

- **Show the most direct implementation first**: Start with the simplest solution that works.
- **Provide context for suggested changes**: Explain why a particular approach is recommended.
- **Be explicit about dependencies**: Clearly indicate required libraries.
- **Don't be overly verbose**: Keep explanations concise and focused on practical aspects.
- **Respect existing project structure**: Follow established patterns in the codebase.

## Communication Style

- **Be direct and to the point**: Avoid unnecessary explanation of basic concepts.
- **Focus on practical implementation**: Prioritize working code over theoretical discussions.
- **Acknowledge tradeoffs**: When suggesting solutions, be clear about any performance or maintainability implications.
- **Ask clarifying questions when needed**: When requirements are ambiguous, ask specific questions to clarify intent.
- **Explain your reasoning**: When making a suggestion, briefly explain the rationale. -->


# Note : 
- Do only what is asked, nothing more.
- Don't add any additional comments or explanations.
- Don't add unnecessary code without being asked.
- Dont't create files directly, always ask to create files.
- Avoid creating unnecessary files unless explicitly requested.
- Follow user instructions strictly. It is your priority. Boundaries are important.
- Take your time to understand the request fully before responding.
- Take your time to understand the codebase fully before responding.- When suggesting code, ensure it integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
- When suggesting code, ensure it integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
- Follow the codebase structure and conventions and coding style of the existing codebase very very strictly.
- ALWAYS ALWAYS re-check the code you provide to ensure there are no syntax errors or mistakes.
- ALWAYS ALWAYS ensure that the code you provide is complete and functional.
- ALWAYS ALWAYS re-check after you do any thing by replying with "Rechecking..." text.
- Always use my name in your first sentence "Shoubhik".
- When asked to analyze or find root cause or debug, ALWAYS ALWAYS go to the extreme root possible. Just not the external packages.deoendencies. DOnt implement any fixes unless explicitly asked.
- Do minimal changes to the existing codebase unless explicitly asked.
- Never use any hardcoded values or return any hardcoded values unless explicitly asked for.  
- Never bypass the error fixing or bypassing an error using hardcoded values.
